Just so you all understand, I know that sound cannot travel through space due to it being a vacuum and all I got that already. These sounds were captured from an orbiting satellite from back in 1999 - 2001 I think. I am not certain on the years exactly. From what I can understand the orbiting satellites have remote censors on them that can translate the radio like frequencies coming off of Mercury so we are able t hear them. Anyways, I thought this sounded a little bit creepy, Hope you enjoy!
