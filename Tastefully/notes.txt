/*------------------ TOP IDEAS -----------------*/

BASIL:
If I had access to unlimited basil, I'd gorge myself silly on pesto. Then I'd make more and freeze it for less summery months. I wonder if you could also freeze the leaves? Either whole or chop up and freeze with a little water in ice cube trays. I've never done that.

Oh! Also, halve roma tomatoes and top with basil, garlic, olive oil, s p. Bake until well roasted, then toss with more fresh basil, lots of parmesan (the real stuff) and spaghetti noodles. So good.

The secret is to chop the basil in the food processor with enough olive oil that all the basil gets coated with oil. This keeps it from turning dark in the freezer, and when you need basil to make something wonderful like basil vinaigrette, or Blog From Our Kitchen's wonderful sounding Pesto with Whole Pine Nuts, you just let it thaw and proceed like it was fresh basil.

Check out her step-by-step photos. So there's one more idea for armloads of basil! We are still using our little plant quite frequently, but we may stock up our freezer with fresh basil around the end of the summer.

Basil-infused olive oil
		You can use basil oil in a vinaigrette for green salad, but it’s also divine drizzled on chicken or roasted eggplant.  For optimum flavor, use within a week.  

		For each cup of olive oil, use two tightly packed cups of basil leaves. Bring a large pan of water to a boil. Add basil, making sure leaves are submerged; blanch for five seconds. Drain in a strainer and immediately plunge basil into a bowl of ice water. Drain well and squeeze dry. Puree in a blender with the olive oil; strain first through a fine-mesh strainer and again through four layers of cheesecloth. Pour into a sterilized glass bottle, cover tightly, and refrigerate.

BUTTER
		Flavored (aka compound) butters are a sophisticated way to enrich a recipe, especially when made with heady fresh herbs like basil.

		Soften a stick of butter at room temperature and then blend with chopped fresh basil, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Place butter on a sheet plastic wrap and form into a log, wrapping tightly with the plastic. Refrigerate until firm. Cut the log crosswise and use pats of butter to garnish baked potatoes, steamed vegetables, crusty bread, or roasted fish.

Sweet basil jelly
	Try this delicious condiment with roast chicken or on a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich.

	Rinse, drain, and coarsely tear enough unblemished basil leaves to make 1 1/2 cups lightly packed. Chop basil in a food processor, put in a large saucepan, and crush it well using the bottom of a glass or bottle. Add 2 cups of water and bring slowly to a boil; boil for 30 seconds. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 15 minutes. Strain 1 1/2 cups of the basil liquid through a sieve into a saucepan. Add 2 tablespoons vinegar, a pinch of salt and 3 1/2 cups sugar and bring to a hard boil, stirring. When the boil can’t be stirred down, add 3 ounces liquid pectin. Return to a hard boil and boil for exactly 1 minute, then remove from heat. Skim off the foam and pour jelly into hot, sterilized jelly glasses, leaving 1/2 inch of headroom. Seal at once with melted paraffin or sterilized two-piece lids. Makes four 8-ounce glasses.

Basil-flavored vinegar
	Flavored vinegars are practically effortless to create. Fill a fancy bottle with them and they make excellent housewarming gifts, too. 

	Pour two cups of white-wine vinegar into a large mason jar, add 8 to 10 fresh basil leaves, two cloves of garlic, and sliced peel from an orange. Place the jar in a dark, cool place for two weeks to allow flavors to develop. To use, strain vinegar through a sieve and store in a cruet or a clean mason jar. Use for salad dressings, marinades, or to drizzle lightly on vegetables, chicken, and fish.

Basil mojito
	Try this spin on the classic mojito at your next party. 

	Combine 8 to 10 basil leaves and 1/4 lime wedge in a sturdy glass. Use a muddler to crush the basil and lime to release the basil oils and lime juice. Add 2 more lime wedges and 2 tablespoons sugar, and muddle again to release more lime juice. Don’t strain the mixture. Fill the glass almost to the top with ice. Pour 1 1/2 ounces of white rum over the ice, and fill the glass with club soda. Stir, taste, and add more sugar if desired. Garnish with one more lime wedge.


Basil-grilled shrimp
	This technique also works for any firm fish such as halibut or cod. The flavor of the basil will infuse the shrimp.

	Cut a great big double handful of basil stems and leaves, wet them thoroughly, and lay them on a medium-hot grill. Spread a layer of raw shrimp over the basil and leave for 60 to 90 seconds. Turn the shrimp over and leave for another 60 to 90 seconds.

Cilantro
	Make some chimichurri sauce with it. In a food processor combine: cilantro, garlic, olive oil, red wine vinegar, sea salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes. It's great on barbecued meats and fish! Or a pesto would be good to make with it as well. In a food processor combine: Cilantro, pepitas, salt, pepper, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice and maybe a spanish hard cheese. Would be great on some pasta or on spring vegetables!


RICE
	Brown rice, fresh cilantro, diced mago, lime juice/zest, salt/pepper and you have an easy side dish that's way more fun than plain rice.

MOLOKHIEH
	With the whole Lebanese trend on this blog, make some Molokhieh! Its a a leafy stew that is rich in cilantro, if you can't find the molokhia leaves chard or spinach works well too.

	I like this recipe, its close to my grandma's. http://www.dirtykitchensecrets.com/mloukhieh/

TABOULEH
	I like to make a simple Tabbouleh with cilantro, onions, tomatoes, lemon juice and salt. It's really good! Or you can go all out and make a quinoa tabbouleh -- http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/2012/06/quinoa-tabbouleh

TEA
	I make it into a tea. Sounds weird but it is surprisingly refreshing.

	Wash a bunch of cilantro, place with 3 cups filtered water into a pot. Boil 10 minutes. Cool, strain, pour into mason jars. Refrigerate until cold, enjoy!

TIP
	That jar-with-water-and-a-bag-over-it-in-the-fridge technique is amazing for cilantro, as I only very recently learned. In the last couple of years I'd all but given up on buying cilantro because it turned to slime after just a day or so in the fridge with my usual herb storage technique of wrapping in a paper towel and then sealing in a plastic bag. Then a couple months ago, after a recent Kitchn post about the the jar technique I decided to give it another try, and my cilantro lasted for nearly two weeks! Incredible and life-changing. : )

	This recipe for Dhania Chicken is one of my all-time favorites, and it uses a ton of cilantro, stems included. It's not pretty, but it's crazy flavorful and easy. 
	http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/05/cilantro-chicken-dhania-chicken-recipe.html?ref=search


	here are my strategies for using up all of the cilantro:

	1. mix with spring-mix salad - fresh herbs always add something lovely and fancy to a green salad.

	2. blend in a little when making hummus

	3. make this slaw (which keeps for days beautifully): 4 c shredded cabbage, juice of 1 lime, few T canola oil, 1 c coarsely-chopped cilantro, salt, pepper. toss cabbage/cilantro together in a bowl. in another bowl, whisk oil, lime, salt, pepper together; pour over cabbage to coat and toss to distribute evenly. PERFECT with tacos, breakfast-for-dinner, all sorts of salady lunches...

	5. my mother's most amazing black bean summer salad: black beans, tomatoes, carrots, bell peppers, cilantro, corn. a little oil/vinegar/salt/pepper/presto!

	4. yes, keep it in a little jar with water. I use a ziploc over the top since it has enough structure to be like a tent over it.

	enjoy! :)


MINT
	foot scrub
	http://www.nichetopics.info/homemade-foot-scrub-recipes.html

	TEA
		Instant mint tea at work, uses up gobs if you do this a couple of times a day.

	Stuff a glass full of mint stalks and one green tea bag. Fill with water. Microwave for 3 minutes. Let it steep for 10 minutes or longer if you happen to be on a call or in a meeting. Drink warm or poured over ice.

	I make a sauce of chopped mint and basil, with some olive oil and chopped garlic and use it on legs of lamb (brush it on while cooking and serve with a puddle on the side). one batch will use two or three healthy handfuls of mint--the ratio of mint to basil important. I also bruise a big handful and scald with milk or cream as a base for ice cream or for pastry cream to line summer fruit tarts (it turns the cream a kind of gray-green so I try to cover as much of it as possible with fruit).

	Just concoted my own recipe for mint chutney, because i had so much mint myself. I used 3 cups mint/2 cups cilantro/a sprinkle of sugar (honey might be nice)/ a jalapeno/ lemon juice/salt and pepper. Put in food processor, puree. I use it as a dip for bread (especially good with na'an), veggies, even tortilla chips.

	Mint pesto recipe
		If your usual basil pesto recipe isn't exciting your taste buds, give this mint pesto recipe a try. Boasting a vibrant flavor, it is a fun change for pasta and is especially good when paired with lamb.

		Yields about 1-1/2 cups

		Ingredients:

		4 ounces fresh mint
		Zest and juice of 1 lemon
		2 cloves garlic, crushed
		1/3 cup toasted pine nuts
		1 cup grated Parmesan
		1/4 to 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
		Salt and freshly ground black pepper
		Directions:

		In the bowl of a food processor, combine mint, lemon zest and juice, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan and 1/4 cup oil. Blend until well-combined.
		Add more olive oil to thin pesto, if desired. Season with salt and pepper.
		Use immediately or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

		Make a yoghurt dressing with chopped mint leaves, natural yoghurt, garlic and salt and 

OREGANO:
	 oregano vinaigrette. Olive oil, fresh lemon juice, lots of dried oregano. I put in sqeeze bottle and use it quite frequently on grilled BBQ chicken, pork, grilled steak, boiled potatoes, boiled eggs, rice, I could go on.....

	 Make lemon oregano chicken!

		1 cup fresh oregano, chopped
		juice and zest from two lemons
		1/4 cup olive oil
		salt & pepper (lots of pepper!!!)

		Combine all of the above and let it sit for about 20 minutes. Rub it all over either a whole chicken for roasting, or cut up chicken pieces. Pour an extra into the chicken's cavity or just over the chicken in a baking dish.

		Roast pieces at 400F for 20 minutes, flip and bake about 20 minutes more. Roast a whole chicken at 400F for about an hour, or until it's done.

		Serve with whatever sides you like. We did mashed potatoes and a green salad.

	Enalata Guanjuato
		Make a batch of ensalada guanjuato, which calls for 2 Tbs of fresh oregano. And then pass along the recipe and some of the herb to your neighbors and friends!







THYME
	
	5Stuff chicken with fresh thyme.
	Place 3 to 4 whole sprigs of thyme and rosemary inside whole chickens that will be roasted or broiled.
	Remove sprigs and discard them after chicken is cooked.
	6Make a thyme-infused spread for crackers.
	Mix together 1 teaspoon of fresh thyme leaves, 1 teaspoon of finely minced chives, 1/8 of a teaspoon of white pepper and 1/8 of a teaspoon salt.
	Blend the seasonings into 3 oz. of softened cream cheese with a food processor.
	Serve the spread with toast triangles or crackers.
